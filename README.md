# QuickCommerce

A quick ecommerce site that I whipped up to test the capabilites to scale a large B2B ecommerce site with Nextjs, TailwindCSS, Prisma, MySQL, and Stripe from a standard PHP, HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery website. I was really happy with the result and how fast I did it. Now to use this approach for the B2B site.
